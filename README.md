# Ousia

Ousia is a project of Zerna.io GmbH. Within this monorepo we develop our public websites, services and want to show examples how modern web frameworks (Svelte, SSI) can set the future of the internet.

## FAQ

#### What is the purpose of this repo?

Within this repository we control all our dependencies and the structure of the applications which are developed and operated within Zerna.io GmbH. For this we use the monorepo approach via pnpm and eventually build an architecture which is needed by other users.

#### Can I just clone the repo and use it for myself?

Since we have decided to make all future work available online, everyone can of course use the repo for themselves. We run the repo under the MIT license. However, we have dependencies that cannot be loaded directly via npm. This includes GSAP, for which we have a business license.
